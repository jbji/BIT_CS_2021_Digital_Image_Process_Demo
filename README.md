# BIT_CS_2021_Digital_Image_Process_Demo
 Beijing Institute of Technology, 2021, Digital Image Process, including Seam Carving Demo & Superpixel SLIC Demo

The Project uses OpenCV 4, experiment reports are included. Read these reports (in Chinese) for further details.

## Superpixel SLIC Demo:

A direct implement of Superpixel SLIC, similar to OpenCV's implementation when using.![Screen Shot 2022-02-23 at 3.36.10 PM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbji/BIT_CS_2021_Digital_Image_Process_Demo/main/imgs/Screen%20Shot%202022-02-23%20at%203.36.10%20PM.png)

## Seam Carving Demo:

Seam Carving for image resize, combined with Canny edge detection & saliency map calculation, using improved energy function.![Screen Shot 2022-02-23 at 3.35.13 PM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbji/BIT_CS_2021_Digital_Image_Process_Demo/main/imgs/Screen%20Shot%202022-02-23%20at%203.35.13%20PM.png)
